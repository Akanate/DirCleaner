# How to contribute properly
Report bugs/problems

Contributing pull requests

## Rules
Make sure when reporting a bug to only open one issue.


Also as a single developer I may need time to apply these patches.


Also before reporting a bug check if it is already being worked on because someone else has put an issue on it.


Make sure to specify OS.

### How to explain the issue
Give me an example of when and how it fails then it can be fixed much better.


Make it very easy to understand so then Iâ€™m not trying to figure out what your saying.

### Read license and code of conduct
Make sure to read these.
